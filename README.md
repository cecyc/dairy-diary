Dairy Diary is a project I built while at The Iron Yard Rails Engineering program.

Dairy Diary is an personal cheese journal that allows you to keep track of cheeses you have tried.

You can:

* Add a new cheese entry
* Add a photo to that entry
* Add a review to that entry

Only you have access to your "reviews." (This is not meant to be a yet another social media app, it is meant to be a private way to keep your thoughts together about cheese.)

###Stuff I used

* Ruby on Rails as a framework
* Deployed on Heroku
* Git for version control
* HTML5 / CSS3
* Death to the Stock Photo for photography.
* Design is mine, but I leveraged MaterializeCSS for certain elements, like forms.
* Refile for handling image uploads
* Amazon S3 for file upload storage
* Devise for user signup / sessions
* Figaro for keeping credentials safe :)
